Numerous improvements will be accomplished progressively, in particular those suggested by our visitors from all countries, such as for instance additional options for the style of charts (especially planets inside), a full page zoom, more secondary bodies, etc. We spare no effort in our endeavour to offer you a convivial and user-friendly site, and we hope that our research work will be helpful to anyone interested in astrology. Our applications are enhanced continuously. We do as best as we can, at our own rhythm. We extend our warmest thanks to our contacts and to all the astrologers who, for more than ten years and on a daily basis, send us valuable suggestions and information to enrich Astrotheme's astrological database. In some cases, the sources request us not protect their anonymity. Several people famous in politics, in the media, the film, music or arts industry, do not want us to disclose that they themselves provided us with their birth time. We keep their mails, and we are prepared to answer individual enquiries by email, on a case-by-case basis, when we are entitled to do so. As indicated in the disclaimer posted on every page of our celebrities' chart, our data are a starting point from which to conduct more advanced research. We develop astrology programmes, we write texts, and our database in only one activity among many others. We do not claim that we possess the truth, and we invite our visitors to do their own verification whenever there is doubt about a time, a location, or a date. It is useful to recall the said disclaimer
