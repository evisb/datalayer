A mutable collection can be updated or extended in place. This means you can change, add, or remove elements of a collection as a side effect. Immutable collections, by contrast, never change. You have still operations that simulate additions, removals, or updates, but those operations will in each case return a <span style="color:#002300"><span style="color:#002300">new</span></span> collection and leave the <span style="color:#001a00">old</span> collection unchanged.<br><br><br>The <span style="color:#000000">last</span> package in the collection hierarchy is collection.<span style="color:#000000"><span style="color:#000000">generic</span></span>.
