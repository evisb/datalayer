# Install Kubernetes on AWS

> Quick Start the Datalayer Science Platform on AWS in 10 minutes.
>
> Check the [requirements](/devops/requirements.md) to setup your local environment.

Check that you understand and have the following requirements.

* An AWS account with valid credentials.
* The [latest Kuber binary release](https://github.com/datalayer/datalayer/releases).

## AWS Credentials

Setup your `AWS` environment with the needed AWS credentials via environment variables.

In your `~/.bashrc` file.

```bash
# Define your valid AWS Credentials.
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-aws-key-id>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-aws-key-secret>
```

If you prefer, you can persist those credentials in your home folder.

```bash
# ~/.aws/credentials
[kuber]
aws_access_key_id=<your-aws-key-id>
aws_secret_access_key=<your-aws-key-secret>
```

```bash
# ~/.aws/config
[kuber]
region=us-west-2
```

## Create the K8S Cluster

```bash
# Run the following.
kuber kcreate dla1 -p aws -z us-west-2 && \ # eu-central-1 also supported.
  kuber kapply dla1 -v 4
```

```bash
# Check the cluster is running.
watch kubectl get nodes && \
  watch kubectl get pods --all-namespaces && \
  kubectl proxy
```

This will give the list of nodes and then the list pods (there will be DNS, Calico as the Tiller pods for Helm).

```

```

## Install the Services

Follow the [instructions to install the services](/install/services/index.md).

## Terminate the K8S Cluster

To terminate the Cluster, run the following command.

```bash
# Delete the cluster.
kuber kdelete dla1 -v 4 --purge
```
