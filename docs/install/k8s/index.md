# Install Kubernetes 

Choose a Kubernetes cluster flavor where you will to install the `Datalayer Science Platform`.

+ Before going to the cloud, [try it on a local Kubernetes cluster with minikube](/install/k8s/minikube.md).
+ When you feel confident with your local env, [install on AWS](/install/k8s/aws.md).

You will then install the [Services](/install/services/index.md) on an existing Kubernetes cluster.
