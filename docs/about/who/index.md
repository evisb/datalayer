# Datalayer Users

As a user, you are looking for agile and low cost iterations during your Data Science Project.

Datalayer targets 3 types of users who can create and/or use cost effective clusters of size they need without prior IT skills.

1. Standalone Data Scientists.
2. Small to medium analytics teams of data-driven business.
3. Small analytics teams of non-data-driven business.

The typical stakeholders of a Data Science project are the `Devops`, a `Data Scientist` or a `Business`.

![Who](/_images/who/who.svg "Profiles")

You may have more than one hat (more than one profile) during the lifecycle of your Data Science project. For those 3 profiles, Datalayer solutions make life easier, more productive, cheaper and bring more business value.

+ [Data Scientists](/about/who/data-scientist.md) use the `Explorer` to explore and share insights in a visual way, in private or in public (e.g. on Twitter). You also use the `Explorer` to request cluster resources for a certain period of time.
+ [Business](/about/who/business.md) review the Data Scientist insights in his favorite environment like Microsoft Office 365 or Google.
+ [Devops](/about/who/devops.md) use the `Kuber CLI` to create the Kubernetes cluster and deploy the needed Applications. You also get the `Kuber UI` if you prefer beautiful screens.

This is applicable in `Exploration` and `Alpha` environments at every steps of your Projects

Big Data Science adoption trend can be summarized as such.

**Business Stakeholders** read and comment `Data Stories`.

**Data Scientists** use their Google drive and publish stories on twitter. They feed and search a `Library` with:

+ Datasets on HDFS and IPFS.
+ Notes to write, publish and reuse.
+ Models to create, publish and reuse.
+ APIs assembled based on Notes, to be deployed and monetized.

They analyse data and share results with `Python`, `R` and `Spark` on the `Datalayer Explorer`, a `JupyterLab` Web Notebook with extensions on a `Kubernetes` cluster.

**Devops** use a `Datalayer` to setup, secure and operate the distributed components that build up the Kubernetes platform.
