# Exploration to Alpha

Current projects organisation is not enough agile and can be summarized as a series of steps, with separated phases.

Datalayer shuffles the phases and allows better agility and collaboration while raising the bar to prepare a faster and cheaper `Exploration-to-Alpha`.

Datalayer fully supports the usage of the exploration artifacts stored in the `Library` into a Alpha environment.

With Datalayer, no more issue. Datalayer ships by default Big Data storage and analytics so you are not limited.

This allows you also to fully reuse what you have done in the Exploration for your Alpha. Still with the ease and flexibility of the well known Python... tooling most Data Scientists love to work with.
