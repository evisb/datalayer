# Kuber

`Datalayer Kuber` is about `Cluster on Demand` and `Operation`.

`Kuber CLI` is the command line interface to connect to the K8S cluster and its applications. `Kuber UI` is the WEB user interface to operate the K8S cluster and its applications.

`Kuber CLI` allows you to create from scratch and manage a Kubernetes cluster with the complete `Datalayer Science Platform`.

You can also use the CLI to deploy additional applications on top of the cluster.

If you prefer an User Interface, we also ship `Kuber UI` which bring the next level of control and monitoring. You can also further analyse the metrics collected from the K8S resources and optimize your costs as enhance the performance for your end users.
