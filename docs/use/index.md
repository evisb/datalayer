# User Guide

Datalayer is about `code` on `data`:

+ Create analysis project and share it.
+ Search what others have created.
+ Collaborate in teams on research projects.
+ Follow people and discover what they do.

## Free Account

Go to the [signup](https://datalayer.io/join) page and create your personal free account. You will need a valid email address to confirm your account.

## Project

You are now ready to create your first project. Give your project `tags` so it can be found easily.

You can add on your project:

+ Datasets.
+ Notebooks.
+ APIS.

The `Datasets` and `Notebooks` are stored on the `public IPFS`.

You will have the option to make them `private`.

## Notebook

The JupyterLab `Notebook` is the WEB user interface to analyse datasets, an innovative WEB user interface for Data Scientists to better collaborate and deliver faster. We have curated and developed extensions for your analysis experience to be `efficient` and `fun`.

## Publish on Twitter

You authenticate with Twitter and share screen captures.
